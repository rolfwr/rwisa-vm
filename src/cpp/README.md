C++ implementation of rwisa-vm (rwa2)
=====================================

Implementation requires c++17 support. Provided (barebones, hardcoded)
build-scripts are bash-scripts depending on clang-7 toolchain.

Build by running either build-script from shell, e.g:
```
./build-release.bash
```

Then execute vm by running the resulting executable, e.g:
```
./vm <path-to-file>
```
